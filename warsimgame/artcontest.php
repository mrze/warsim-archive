<center><b>ART CONTEST!</b></center>
<p><br />
  <br />
It is widely known that the Author of Warsim, has virtually no artistic talent whatsoever, so, in an effort to spruce up the Warsim website, We are holding a contest to make Warsim PRETTY AGAIN!<br />
<br />
Prizes will range from credits in P4S games, to a free private game being set up for you and your faction to play in, to ships with unique paintjobs and alternate weapon fitouts. <br>
<br>
To submit something, make sure its exported to JPG or PNG format and not too big [200k per image tops peoples], zip it up into an archive with any others you wish to submit, and send it to my email with the message line &quot;Warsim Art Contest - I Like Monkeys&quot;, and the files attached or linked to. <br>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Stuff that Needs to be Done:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Warsim Header &amp; Sidebanner [+ Slogan?] <br>
<br><center><img src="images/gui/artcont1.gif" /></center>
</strong></p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong>Will be used on the Lobby, Index and any pages which use that template. It needs to look clean, good, and have `Warsim` written somewhere on it. JPG or PNG format only. It can be as big or as small as you want, but preferably there should be a horizontal header that will go up the top, and a sidebanner that will stick alongside the main body of the page. You can download the HTML page and make a header in HTML Tables also. <br>
  <br>
  If you can make a slogan for Warsim, that will be a bonus. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Prize: </strong>350k (in the currently running Public Ships for Credits game) <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Warsim In Game Header
  <br>
  <br><center><img src="images/gui/artcont2.gif" /></center>
  <br>
  <br>
  Description:</strong> This will be used when you are in a game, so it MUST be sleek, it must be very small in filesize and dimensions, JPG or PNG format only! And it must look Cool. Johnny Bravo Style Cool. Thats very cool. <br>
  <br>
  If you can incorporate the `tab links` within it, then thats very cool. Allow space for another tab link `Capture` between Docking and Scanner.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Prize: </strong>700k (in the current Public ships for credits game) <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Rules Images</strong> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Description:</strong> The Warsim Rules page contains alot of links that arn't actually links. I want screenshots [cropped, so no browser is shown] illustrating some of the points shown in the rules. Where it says &quot;

  &raquo; Click here to view the ship listing &quot; and other links like that need images, go play warsim, create an image, crop it, export it and send it to me, if its good, then it will be used. Rules can be found <a href="help.php">here</a>. It is not limited to the pictures that don't have links, if you see a section that you think should have a picture, make one, and send it to me. <br>
  <strong><br>
  Prize: </strong>25k per image used. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Rules - Tractor Beams</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Description: </strong>Tractor beams are hard to formulate rules over. I need some rules, including descriptions, equations and formulas to show how tractor beams Should be implented. Warsim Ships use the same tractor beam values as SWC ships. Warsim also uses the manu, speed and hull/ionic/shield values as SWC. An example of an entry:<br>
<br>
<div align="center"><table width="90%" ><td class="yellow">Tractor beams should be able to lock onto fighter squadrons and lower their maneuverability by 1. They should last for 3 minutes then have to be recharged, which takes 2 minutes. <br>
<br>
if (Rand(1,100) &gt; ((25 * fighter manu) / cap manu)) then locked on, else missed.</td></table></div>
  <br>
  <br>That one would not be accepted, as it is far too simple. Warsim does not use KISS. KISS is for boring games with conventional programmers :P
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Prize:</strong> Undecided yet. Depends how good entries get. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Rules - Random Suggestions</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Description:</strong> I may have completely forgotten something when I built warsim, like Space Stations, hell, they exist, but they arnt in warsim, so WTF? If you think something should be added, and have a good reason, and some rules, even if they are basic, tell me, Ill be glad to hear how I can improve my game. <br>
  <br>
  Things coming up [So dont suggest]: Capturing ships, Scenarios...<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Prize: </strong>Undecided. Depends on suggestions.
